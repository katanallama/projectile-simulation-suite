#+title: Documentation

This directory is the home of the project documentation, including:

- [[./charter.md][Simple project charter]]
- [[./schedule.md][Project schedule]]
- [[./res][Project working files]]

All are living documents and are expected to change, feel free to contribute to them.

** Note
- ~.org~ are working files and exported to ~.md~ as GitHub does not parse org-mode files well
- If using VSCode or another editor that does not respect ~.editorconfig~ files, please install a [[https://editorconfig.org/][plugin]]
