#+title: Documentation

This directory is the home of the project documentation, including:

- [[./charter.md][Simple project charter]]

- [[./schedule.md][Project schedule]]

- [[./spec.md][Problem specification and design requirements]]

- [[./design.md][Design Documentation]]

- [[./res][Project working files]]

All are living documents and are expected to change, feel free to contribute to them.

** Contribution Notes
- ~.org~ are working files and exported to ~.md~ as GitHub does not parse org-mode files well
- If using VSCode or another editor that does not respect ~.editorconfig~ files, please install a [[https://editorconfig.org/][plugin]]

** Adding new dependencies

To update the dependencies, update ~pom.xml~ run ~nix build~ and set the ~mvnHash~ in ~./default.nix~ :

~outputHash = "";~ remove the old hash

~direnv reload~, so long as you have ~direnv~ installed or,

~nix build`

#+begin_src sh
warning: found empty hash, assuming 'sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA='
[1/0/3 built, 0.0 MiB DL] building maven-repository (buildPhase): Downloading from central: https://redirenv:

            got:    sha256-CrXCiJgU5kKywK7D01YrSk+teXkAMvrYmbNCh7lWX0I=
#+end_src

Update the hash in ~./default.nix~:

~outputHash = "sha256-CrXCiJgU5kKywK7D01YrSk+teXkAMvrYmbNCh7lWX0I=";~

~direnv reload~

The environment should reload on the next command as `direnv` is set to watch `*.nix` and `pom.xml`
