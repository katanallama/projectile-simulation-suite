* Update 1
#+begin_quote
Please update your GitLab .md files with 'Problem Specification and Design Requirements'. Create a separate section for each.

In 'Design Requirements' section, you need to specify 'Objectives, Functions and Constraints' each in a separate sub-section. You should consider at least four constraints overarching your design. Following is the list of some constraints (you can also come up your with your own constraints).

Economic Factors
Regulatory Compliance (Security and Access)
Reliability
Sustainability and Environmental Factors
Ethics
Societal Impacts
The deadline to finish the work is Friday June 02, 23:59:59.
